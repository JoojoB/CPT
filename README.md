The file contains the code in python usingthe panda library to process data from 15 Cone Penetration Test locations to give the sort and group soil layers and find the percentage in that test location.
This helps to find the depth of the various soil types and help compute for shaft friction of pile and ultimately the bearing capacity of the soil.
Subsequent additions will include using the results to compute the shaft friction and bearing capacity of a soil
